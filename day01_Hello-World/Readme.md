# Day 01 of 100 Python Projects

# Description
The initiation ritual for every programmimg language. 

# Sample Output
Hello World

# What I learnt
Today I learnt more about github than python because I already had python set up and in all honesty I had already done my authentic hello world script about a year earlier than this.
I think I like github and I'm going to spend a lot of time here. 

Cheers to the rest of the 100-day journey
