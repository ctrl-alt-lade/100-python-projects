# 100-python-projects
This repository contains the projects and assignments in the udemy course: Python Mastery- 100 days of python projects

# Why I'm doing this
I'm doing this for the experience. This is my chance to learn python and stick with it, especially with my progress being made public in it's own little way.
Here is the textbook, formal looking answer though:
- Build discipline by coding every day.
- Explore beginner-to-intermediate Python concepts.
- Create a shareable record of growth and improvement.
- Make my GitHub profile more attractive for internships and personal learning.


# Here is a list of all the projects as I'm working through them.
