# Day 02 Crash Course
No project today. 
Today's session was for a crash course on python. I'm not completely new to the software but it was something that needed to happen.

Even without the outright project label. I wrote very simple examples of the concepts covered in the lesson.

##Lessons Learnt
Today, I briefly covered concepts like:
- Variables
- Arithmetic
- Decisions
- Loops
  - Y loop
  - Forward Loop
- Lists
- FUnctions

# Mini Project
At the end of the crash course there was a mini game, a **Number Guessing Game**

### Sample Output
Here is a simple output from the mini project
*I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10
Take a Guess2
Too low! Try again.
Take a Guess5
Congratulations! You guessed the number!*

## Lesson from the project
- I learned that libraries can be imported into projects
- I learnt from a mistake I made where I turned a function into a variable unintentionally. This initially cause the program to return an error pointing to a line that was actually fine. After some de-bugging, I was able to get it running properly.
- I learnt how to convert data received by the user into an integer variable directly instead of letting it stay as a string variable.
- I learnt how to apply decisions
